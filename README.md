## 📋 Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Frontend  │◄────►│   Backend   │◄────►│  Database   │
│  React.js   │      │  Node.js    │      │  MongoDB    │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
                           ▲
                           │
                     ┌─────┴─────┐
                     │    AI     │
                     │ Services  │
                     └───────────┘
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern** for backend structure
- **Context API** for state management
- **Repository Pattern** for data access
- **Service Layer** for business logic

## 🌟 AI Features in Depth

The application integrates Google's Generative AI (Gemini API) to provide intelligent features that enhance the CRM experience:

### 1. Natural Language to Rules Conversion
Users can describe their target audience in plain English, such as:
- "Customers who spent more than $1000 and visited less than 3 times"
- "Inactive users who haven't made a purchase in 90 days"
- "High-value customers with more than 5 visits"

The AI converts these descriptions into precise segmentation rules with appropriate fields, operators, and values, making segment creation more intuitive.

### 2. Smart Message Generation
The platform generates personalized marketing messages based on:
- Campaign objectives and descriptions
- Target audience characteristics
- Best practices for engagement

Messages are tailored with personalization tokens (e.g., {{name}}) and appropriate calls to action.

### 3. Multi-model Fallback Strategy
To ensure reliability, the AI service attempts to use different models in order of preference:
1. `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (fastest, most efficient)
2. `gemini-1.5-flash` (good balance of speed and quality)
3. `gemini-1.5-pro` (highest quality for complex prompts)

This ensures consistent service even if certain models have availability issues.

### 4. Error Handling & Fallbacks
The system gracefully handles AI service failures with:
- Appropriate error messages to users
- Fallback template responses for critical features
- Backend retry logic with exponential backoff

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
